(1, 'Richard Feynman', 'These are the lectures in physics that I gave last year and the year before to the freshman and sophomore classes at Caltech. The lectures are, of course, not verbatim—they have been edited, sometimes extensively and sometimes less so. The lectures form only part of the complete course. The whole group of 180 students gathered in a big lecture room twice a week to hear these lectures and then they broke up into small groups of 15 to 20 students in recitation sections under the guidance of a teaching assistant. In addition, there was a laboratory session once a week. The special problem we tried to get at with these lectures was to maintain the interest of the very enthusiastic and rather smart students coming out of the high schools and into Caltech. They have heard a lot about how interesting and exciting physics is—the theory of relativity, quantum mechanics, and other modern ideas. By the end of two years of our previous course, many would be very discouraged because there were really very few grand, new, modern ideas presented to them. They were made to study inclined planes, electrostatics, and so forth, and after two years it was quite stultifying. The problem was whether or not we could make a course which would save the more advanced and excited student by maintaining his enthusiasm. Thelecturesherearenotinanywaymeanttobeasurveycourse, butarevery serious.

(3, 'ChempHy', 'say in water, and we put a big ball of something in the water, a ball much bigger than the atoms, the ball will jiggle around—much as ush ball game, where a great big ball is pushed around by a lot of people. The people are pushing in various directions, and the ball moves around the ?eld in an irregular fashion. So, in the same way, the “large ball” will move because of the inequalities of the collisions on one side to the other, from one moment to the next. Therefore, if we look at very tiny particles (colloids) in water through an excellent microscope, we see a perpetual jiggling of the particles, which is the result of the bombardment of the atoms. This is called the Brownian motion. We can see further evidence for atoms in the structure of crystals. In many cases the structures deduced by x-ray analysis agree in their spatial “shapes” with the forms actually exhibited by crystals as they occur in nature. The angles between the various “faces” of a crystal agree, within seconds of arc, with angles deduced on the assumption that a crystal is made of many “layers” of atoms. Everything is made of atoms. Thatisthekeyhypothesis. Themostimportant hypothesisinallofbiology, forexample, isthat everything that animals do, atoms\r\n1-8\r\ndo. Inotherwords, there is nothing that living things do that cannot be understood from the point of view that they are made of atoms acting according to the laws of physics. This was not known from the beginning: it took some experimenting and theorizing to suggest this hypothesis, but now it is accepted, and it is the most useful theory for producing new ideas in the ?eld of biology. If a piece of steel or a piece of salt, consisting of atoms one next to the other, can have such interesting properties; if water—which is nothing but these little blobs, mile upon mile of the same thing over the earth—can form waves and foam, and make rushing noises and strange patterns as it runs over cement; if all of this, all the life of a stream of water, can be nothing but a pile of atoms, how much more is possible? If instead of arranging the atoms in some de?nite pattern, again and again repeated, on and on, or even forming little lumps of complexity like the odor of violets, we make an arrangement which is always di?erent from place to place, with di?erent kinds of atoms arranged in many ways, continually changing, notrepeating, how muchmore marvelously is itpossible thatthis thing might behave? Is it possible that that “thing” walking back and forth in front of you, talking to you, is a great glob of these atoms in a very complex arrangement, such that the sheer complexity of it staggers the imagination as to what it can do? When we say we are a pile of atoms, we do not mean we are merely a pile of atoms, because a pile of atoms which is not repeated from one to the other might well have the possibilities which you see before you in the mirror.\r\n', 'ts2.jpg', 'NOOE', 'wert', '2020-09-05 12:03:03'),

Thusthe fundamentalprocessesinthemusclethatmakemechanicalmotionsarenotknown. Biologyissuchanenormouslywide?eldthattherearehostsofotherproblems that we cannot mention at all—problems on how vision works (what the light does in the eye), how hearing works, etc. (The way in which thinking works we shall discuss later under psychology.) Now, these things concerning biology which we have just discussed are, from a biological standpoint, really not fundamental, at the bottom of life, in the sense that even if we understood them we still would not understand life itself. To illustrate: the men who study nerves feel their work is very important, because after all you cannot have animals without nerves. But you can have life without nerves. Plants have neither nerves nor muscles, but they are working, they are alive, just the same. So for the fundamental problems of biology we must look deeper; when we do, we discover that all living things have a great many characteristics in common. The most common feature is that they are made of cells, within each of which is complex machinery for doing things chemically. In plant cells, for example, there is machinery for picking up light and generating glucose, which is consumed in the dark to keep the plant alive. When the plant is eaten the glucose itself generates in the animal a series of chemical reactions very closely related to photosynthesis (and its opposite e?ect in the dark) in plants. In the cells of living systems there are many elaborate chemical reactions, in which one compound is changed into another and another. To give some impression of the enormous e?orts that have gone into the study of biochemistry, the chart in Fig. 3-1 summarizes our knowledge to date on just one small part of the many series of reactions which occur in cells, perhaps a percent or so of it. Here we see a whole series of molecules which change from one to another in a sequenceorcycleofrathersmallsteps. ItiscalledtheKrebscycle,therespiratory cycle. Each of the chemicals and each of the steps is fairly simple, in terms of what change is made in the molecule, but—and this is a centrally important discoveryin biochemistry—thesechangesare relatively di?cult to accomplish in a laboratory.

(5, 'NueWaves', 'This fact also has an interesting consequence in the case of piles which make neutrons (these are obviously particles, for anybody’s money!). If we take these neutrons and let them into a long block of graphite, the neutrons di?use and work their way along (Fig. 2-7). They di?use because they are bounced by the atoms, but strictly, in the wave theory, they are bounced by the atoms because of di?raction from the crystal planes. It turns out that if we take a very long piece of graphite, the neutrons that come out the far end are all of long wavelength! In fact, if one plots the intensity as a function of wavelength, we get nothing except for wavelengths longer than a certain minimum (Fig. 2-8). In other words, we can get very slow neutrons that way. Only the slowest neutrons come through; they are not di?racted or scattered by the crystal planes of the graphite, but keep going right through like light through glass, and are not scattered out the sides. There are many other demonstrations of the reality of neutron waves and waves of other particles', '', 'BKP', 'Wave', '2020-09-05 23:04:13'),
(6, 'Mecha uni', 'The scourge of false information is a concept that has existed from before humans ever began to communicate via writing or drawing. Plenty of animals use it as a safety measure, to distract or confuse predators from feeding on them. Their survival depends on such measures. Likewise, predators exhibit much the same behaviour, in order to catch their prey off guard. It\'s quite a cycle if you think about it.\r\nThe rate at which false information entered into human society and human conversations only increased once we discovered how to make our thoughts permanent, either on cave walls, or on papyrus. And that rate has increased considerably as the number of people in contact with one person rises, and the latency in their communication decreases.\r\nThere is a substantial difference between false information, and misinformation. False information, as the name suggests, is information that is false. Misinformation is a particular type of false information, and is characterised by its being spread, usually with the intent to mislead consumers, but not always.\r\nThe popular six degrees of separation idea seems to be an interesting thought experiment when one first comes across it. However, think about it a little more and it is suddenly very, very scary to realise how people who may exercise more power (either politically or financially) could be influenced by some small misinformation in their networks. Thus it becomes crystal clear  that it is essential for humanity, more than ever, to learn how to tackle misinformation in our present day and age.\r\nNow we can\'t obviously begin to discuss misinformation, without first citing examples of the obvious real dangers that misinformation can and has caused, whether it be Donald Trump in his bid to stockpile hydroxychloroquine in an attempt to make the United States of America better prepared to fight COVID-19 infections; or the Indian media, that latched onto a rumour about a very unfortunate incident involving a beloved actor, resulting in his partner being sent to jail—not for the act of murder (as was trumpeted from every platform 24x7 for a few weeks) but on a much more modest charge of drug abuse (more of a \"since we have them here lets book them\" sort of judgement).\r\nThe list, once we begin recalling incidents in popular media, seems to become a never-ending torrent of misinformation polluting whatever little reputable information that we do have access to. There is also a spike in cynicism from those who believe that the information they have access to, is the gospel truth. This leads to all sorts of divisive arguments between groups of people, that most of you reading this might be used to seeing over the past few years, given the rise of an ever popular \"They\'re not telling you this\" narrative.\r\nHere\'s where misinformation begins to plant its most infamous seeds. It is within the context of pitting humans against each other, or communities against each other, that we see how truly insidious the act of spreading misinformation, performed by those who require such division to exist in society. Our Indian context offers plenty of examples to think about, whether it be Mohd. Akhlaqh being lynched in 2015 on the mere suspicion of consuming beef, or the violence that took place in Delhi in February. Indian society, already splintered into many pieces along the lines of caste, economic background and religion, seems to be a place where we can see misinformation being used as a political tool, in a masterfully twisted manner.\r\nIt is at this point that I invite you to listen to a song by Bob Dylan that seems to capture the political implications of leading unsuspecting folk towards actions that most rational people would otherwise balk at.

Just because information comes to you from a source that you trust doesn\'t mean it does not need to be questioned. If it\'s something that you don\'t know the source for, all the more reason for you to ask the questions: \"Is this trying to elicit an emotional reaction from me?\", \"Does there seem to be an ulterior motive to this news?\", \"Is this information trying to get me to turn against a certain set of people, who I may not know personally?\", \"Where is this information coming from?\", \"Have all sides of the information been presented or is something missing?\". Through the very act of asking such questions, you begin to be more aware of the motives of those trying to spread their lies, and become better equipped to educate others around you. \r\n\\#Secondly:#\\ There\'s a scene in Whiplash where JK Simmons\' character says \"There are no two words in the English language more harmful than ‘good job’.\" (Bad teaching methods btw but keeping that aside) I disagree as there are two even more harmful words, ‘Forward Message.’ Even the most well-meaning individuals (including myself) are guilty of doing this at times, and there are always excuses, \"Oh, it\'s harmless”, “I thought it would be useful” etc. In the current age most people know multiple relatives who are the nodal officers in charge of spewing out these messages, both innocent and deadly. Not forwarding a message that\'s already been forwarded multiple times is probably the single best thing you could do to serve everyone you know.\r\n\\#Thirdly:#\\ Do your research. At this point you\'re ready to close this blog post, but I\'m going to ask you to stay for two more points before I close. If you feel that certain information looks suspicious, the right answers are a Google/DuckDuckGo search away (in this house we stan alternatives to monopolies). Or you could consult people in your social circles who are better equipped to point you in the right direction. Of course, refer to step one when searching for \'correct\' information. This is important.\r\n\\#Fourthly:#\\ Remember to call out misinformation when you see it, whether it be on TV channels, on official news reports, on WhatsApp forwards, or on your social media. Everybody is waiting for someone else to take the awkward step of putting their hands up and saying \"Umm I don\'t think that information is right, you seem to be misinformed.\" Naturally, you\'ll have to have finished going through step three. Points to keep in mind when calling out misinformation before you take the step:\r\n1. Make sure the person you\'re correcting isn\'t more qualified to speak on the matter than yourself (looking at you mansplainers :|).\r\n2. Make sure you\'re open to being corrected if your research was wrong.\r\n3. Be ready to get ridiculed/face some sort of bluster if the person isn\'t ready to accept this criticism. Your speaking out has helped everyone who has heard the both of you.
